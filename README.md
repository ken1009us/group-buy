# GROUP BUY

#### Video Demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnb59A2XoEk>

#### Inspiration:

It is annoying that people will experience issues after purchasing a lot of products when they don't actually need that many. For instance, when buying in bulk, the item typically comes with the number that a family can use for a few weeks or months.

#### What it does:

To help individuals identify the products they want to buy and share with other families or students, as well as to help them save money and make shopping easier, we are developing an application. People frequently waste it or are unsure of what to do with extra stuff they don't need. Using our software, users may share the thing they need with those who are in need of it and locate it themselves.

#### How we built it:

We created a web application by using React which is a JavaScript framework for building web apps, and we used express to build the backend side.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm install express --save
$ npm install --save mysql2
$ npm install http-errors
$ npm install axios

$ npx create-react-app my-app
```

## Preparation

```bash
$ nvm use 16.14.2
```

## Execution

Run the application with:

```
npm start
```

Then you can open http://localhost:XXXX to check the program.

Now we are ready to go!
